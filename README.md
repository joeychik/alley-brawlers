One of the key features distinguishing Alley Brawlers from other generic street-fighter based brawler games is the randomized character generation. As the number of games played reaches infinity, the superior character balancing system starts to shine. Theoretically, over the course of an infinite amount of games, two Alley Brawler players equally matched in skill will have exactly 50% wins and 50% losses. The only way that out superior balancing system can be improved is by the use of a truly random number generator, which will be implemented as soon as we can find a way to easily implement it.
